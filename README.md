# 🌍 Global Cancer Patients Analysis (2015–2024)

This project analyzes global cancer patient data from 2015 to 2024 using Python, Power BI, and a structured CSV dataset. It provides insights into cancer types, gender distribution, geographic prevalence, and yearly trends.

## 📁 Project Files

1. **global_cancer_patients_2015_2024.csv**
   - Cleaned dataset containing patient records including age, gender, country, cancer type, stage, survival years, and treatment costs.

2. **global_cancer_patients_2015_2024.py**
   - Python script that performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) using:
     - Gender and age distribution plots
     - Top 10 cancer types and countries
     - Year-wise and stage-wise trends
     - Uses `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for visualizations

3. **Global Cancer Dashboard (2015–2024).pbix**
   - Power BI dashboard with interactive visuals:
     - Country-wise and cancer-type-wise analysis
     - Stage distribution
     - Year-wise trend visualization
     - Easy filtering and slicing capabilities for exploration

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Identifies the most common cancer types worldwide
- Shows patient demographics by gender and age
- Highlights regions with the highest reported cases
- Provides stage-wise distribution and temporal trends

## ✅ Usage
1. Run the Python file to perform initial EDA.
2. Open the Power BI file to explore data interactively.
